# üöó Driving License Management System (DVLD)

## üìù Overview

This repository contains a **.NET Framework Windows Forms** application that manages the full lifecycle of driving-licence‚Äìrelated operations for a Department of Vehicles & Licensing Division (DVLD).  
The system provides a modern, multi-tier architecture with **Presentation**, **Business**, and **Data-Access** layers, backed by a SQL Server database (`DVLD.bak`).

Key modules include:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **People** | Central registry of citizens and personal data |
| **Drivers** | Generates driver profiles once a licence is issued |
| **Applications** | Handles all licence application types (new, renew, replace lost/damaged, international, etc.) |
| **Tests** | Manages written, practical & vision tests, including retakes |
| **Licences** | Issues, detains, renews, and releases driving licences |
| **User & Login** | Role-based authentication and authorisation |
| **Global / Utilities** | Common helpers, settings, and shared enumerations |
